\chapter{Evaluation}
\label{evaluation}
\index{evaluation|(}

In this chapter we will evaluate our prototypes with respect to the quantitative and qualitative aspects of the different feedback methods. We are interested to what extent the perception of feedback differs onshore versus underwater regarding time until the stimulus is perceived. Afterwards the user gives feedback in order to tell if the conditions make a difference with respect to preference. 


Since vibro-tactile and visual feedback is common today for several application ashore we let users test it onshore as well as under water. We drop sound in the underwater condition since it requires specific waterproof earphones or bone conduction headphones. Both exist and provide a comparable quality. The wireless connection however is not trivial underwater.
